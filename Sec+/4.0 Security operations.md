#### Secure baselines
- security of an application environment should be well defined
- Integrity measurements check
- **Establish baseline**
	- often available from the manufacturer
		- App dev
		- OS manufacturer
	- policies
- **Deploy baselines**
	- may require
		- AD group policy, MDM
	- usually managed by central console
- **Maintain**
	- rarely change
	- other baselines may require ongoing updates
	- test and measure to avoid conflicts
#### Hardening targets
- no system is secure with default configurations
- hardening guides are specific to platform or software
- **Mobile devices**
	- checklists are available from manufactures
	- Segmentation can protect data
	- Update  your phone
	- control wit MDM
- **Workstations**
	- desktop
	- constant monitoring and updates
	- automate the monthly patches
	- connect to policy management system
	- remove unnecessary software
- **Network infrastructure**
	- Switches, routers
	- purpose-built devices - embedded OS
	- configure auth, dont use defaults
	- check updates with the manufacturer
- **Cloud infrastructure**
	- least privilege
		- to all services
	- Configure **Endpoint Detection and Response**(EDR)
		- all devices accessing the cloud should be secure
		- always have backups(C2C)
- **Servers**
	- updates, service packs
	- User accounts
		-  minimum password lengths and complexity
	- account limitations
	- AV/AM
- **SCADA/ICS**
	- PC manages equipment
		- power gen, refining
		- facilities, industrial, energy
	- Distributed control systems
		- real-time information control
	- Requires extensive segmentation
		- no access from the outside
- **Embedded systems**
	- hardware and Software designed for a specific function
	- can be difficult to update
		- watches, TV - easy
	- segment and firewall
- **RTOS**
	- deterministic 
		- no time to wait for process
		- automobiles, military environments
	- isolate the system
	- run with the minimum services
- **IoT devices**
	- heating, cooling, lighting
	- weak defaults
		- change password
	- deploy updates quickly
	- segmentation
		- but IoT on their own segment
#### Securing Wireless and Mobile
- **Site surveys**
	- identify existing AP
	- work around existing frequencies
	- plan for ongoing site surveys
	- heat maps
		- identify strength
	- tools
		- signal coverage
		- potential inference
		- Built-in tools
		- 3rd-party
		- spectrum analyzer
- **MDM**
	- manage company owner and user-owned mobile devices(BYOD)
	- centralized management of the mobile devices
	- set policies on apps, data, camera
		- control remote device
	- manage access control
- **COPE(Corporate owned, personally enabled)**
	- company buys a the device
	- used for corporate and personal device
	- information is protected using policies
- **CYOD(Choose Your Own Device)**
	- Similar to COPE, but with the user's choice of device
- **Cellular networks**
	- "Cell" phones
	- 4G, 5G
	- separate land into cells
	- security concerns
		- traffic monitoring
		- location tracking
- **Bluetooth**
	- connects our mobiles devices
	- do not connect to unknown bluetooth devices
