- **Site resiliency**
	- recovery site
		- data is synchronized
	- disaster is called
	- problem addressed
	- revert back to primary location
- **Hot site**
	- exact replica
	- stocked with hardware
	- constantly updated
- **Cold site**
	- no hardware, empty building
	- no data
	- no people
- **Warm site**
	- between **cold** and **hot**
- **Geographic dispersion**
	- sites should be physically different than orgs primary location
- **Platform diversity**
	- every OS has security issues
