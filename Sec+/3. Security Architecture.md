#### Cloud infrastructure
- **Hybrid cloud**
	- more than one public or private cloud
	- Network protection mismatches
		- must make configuration on all servers separately
	- Data is shared across public Internet
- **Third-party vendor**
	- vendor risk management
	- incident response
	- constant monitoring
- **Cloud responsibility matrix**
	- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
	- ![[Pasted image 20250122053156.png]]
- **Infrastructure as code**
	- Define servers network, application as code
	- you can create versions
	- you can build application instances
- Serverless architecture
	- Function as a Service(FaaS)
		- application are separated into individual functions
	-  managed by third-party
- Microservices & API
	-  app contains all decision making processes
	- large codebase
	- APIs
		-  Work together to act as the application
		-  scalable
		- containment is built-in
#### Network infrastructure
- Physical isolation
	- air gap between SW A & SW B
	- must be connected to provide communication
	- web server in in one rack and databse on another
- **SDN(Software Defined Networking)**
	- planes
		- Dara, control, management
	- Data plane
		- process network frames and packets
		- forwarding, encrypting, NAT
	- Control plane
		- manages the action of the data plane
		- routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
		- Dynamic routing
	- Management plane
		- configure and manage the device
		- ssh, browser, API
#### Infrastructure concepts
- Cloud-based
	- no dedicated hardware
	- third-party handles everything
- On-premises
	- client must secure your own data
	- local team for security can be expensive
		- maintains uptime and availability
	- Security changes can take time
- Centralized
	- at one place
		- alerts
		- log file analysis
		- complex maintance, patching
		- Single point of failure
- Virtualization
	- each application instance has own OS
- Containerization
	- you run application in it, unit software
	- isolated process in sandbox
		- Apps can't interact with each other
- IoT
	- Sensors
		- heating, cooling, lighting
	- Home automation
	- watches
	- Weak defaults
		- manufactures are not security professionals
- SCADA
	- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
	- pc manages equipment 
	- real-time information
	- require segmentation
- RTOS(Real-time OS)
	- automobiles, Military environments
	- need to be always available
- Embedded systems
	- HW & SW designed for specific function
	- built for one task
	- example
		- traffic light controllers
		- digital watches
		- medical imaging systems
- High availability
	- always on, always available
	- different components working together
	- higher cost
#### Infrastructure Considerations
- Availability
	- system uptime
	- balancing with security
	- important metric
- Resilience
	- How quickly you can recover?
	- variables
		- root cause
		- hardware installation
		- software patch availability
	- MTTR(mean time to repair)
- Cost
	- How much money is required
	- initial installation
	- maintance
	- replacement
	- tax
- Responsiveness
	- How quickly?
	- Important for interactive applications
- Scalability
	- How we can increase/decrease capacity?
		- elasticity
	- extend when system is bigger
	- need to include security monitoring
- Ease of deployment
	- web server, database, caching server, firewall
	- budget
	- can be automated
- Risk transference
	- Cybersecurity insurance
		- attacks and downtime can be covered
	- Recover internal losses
	- protect against legal issues from customers
- Ease of recovery
	- Malware infection
		- reload OS with original media, or with corporate image
- Patch availability
	- bug fixes, security updates
	- first task after installation
	- regular updates
- Inability to patch
	- Embedded systems
		- HVAC controls
		- Time clocks
	- need additional security control
		- firewall
- Power
	- foundational element
	- power requirements
		- Data center vs office building
	- backup services
		- UPS(Uninterruptible Power Supply)
		- generators
- Compute
	- compute engine
	- may be limited to a single processor
	- Use multiple CPUs for:
		- Additional complexity
		- enhanced scalability
